#  Overview

You can learn more about the background and general design of Loopring protocol in our [white-paper](https://github.com/Loopring/whitepaper/raw/master/en_whitepaper.pdf). As we proceed with implementation, some details in the white-paper are out-dated. Whenever there are differences, please refer to this website as the latest official update - we are not updating our white-paper often, if ever.

## Roles

In Loopring's decentralized exchange ecosystem, there are the multile distinct roles, they jointly provide all functionalities a centralized exchange has to offer. These roles include:

- [Protocol smart-contract](projects/protocol.md)
- [Wallets](projects/wallet.md)
- [Relays](projects/relay.md)
- [Ring-Miners](projects/ringminer.md)
- [Asset Tokenization Services](projects/tokenization.md)

Each of them will be documented in its own page.
