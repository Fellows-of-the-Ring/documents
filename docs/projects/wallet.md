One of Loopring's objectives is to enalbe token exchange right from your wallets. You will no longer have to deposit your assets into an exchange for custody, you will no longer trade IOU. Wallet is the unified place you manange your assets, make transfers, and exchange tokens. 


Loopring's engineering team are working on a web-based wallet, or the *Loopring Wallet*, that supports:

- basic ETH transactions
- Loopring trading

In future releases, ERC20 common operations and queries are likely to be supported as well. We started this project from the wonderful [MyEtherWallet code base](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet), and will keep the code open-sourced. We realized the importance of a user-friendly wallet for the community to take advangate of the power that Loopring will provide. But our goal is not to commercialize Loopring Wallet for a larger user base, instead we enourage people to clone our codebase and develop an even better wallet or app that supports decentralized token exchange using Loopring or even together with other protocols, such as 0x, Kyber, or AirSwap. 

In order to support Loopring protocol, wallet developers should refer to [Relay specification/JSONRPC document](relay.md), this document is also under construction and will have its first version released soon.


In order to make it easier for your UX/UI designers and engineerings understand our wallet, we are preparing a [PRD document](wallet/prd.md).
