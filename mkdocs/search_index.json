It is the core of Loopring ecosystem and offers the following functionalites:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing each order's current state\n\n\nWhen orders are propagated off-chain, they never mutate, which means even when they are partially filled or cancelled, in the peer-to-peer network, different parties still see the same exact orders - otherwise orders need to be re-signed each time they get partially filled or cancelled. The protocol will verify the order's signature against its original state and compute order's current state based on the order's fill history, cancellation records, and its corresponding outgoing address's balance as well ERC20 allowance. All future matching and price/fee calculation is based on order's current states. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifying Miner-supplied Values\n\n\nBecause of the lack of float number computing capalibity, Loopring demands ring-miners to calculate the amount of token each order should pay to the next/previous order in the ring. The protocol shall verify these amounts as well as fees to be collected by miners are calculated correctly. Price and fee calculation deserve a detailed articulation, thus they have their own dedicated sections below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfering Tokens for Settlement\n\n\nThe protocol will transfer ERC20 tokens between order addresses by using the \nTokenTransferDelegate\n. The introduction of such a delegate makes upgrading Loopring protocol easier as all orders only need to authorize this delegate instead of different versions of the protocol. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel or Partially Cancel Orders\n\n\nOrders can be cancelled by invoking the \ncancelOrder\n protocol method. The other way to pseudo-cancel an order is to move all funds into a different address from the one the order's signed by. We may need to provide a batchCancelOrder method in next version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaitaining Fill History and Emit Events\n\n\nIn order to compute each order's current state, the protocol keeps track of each order's total filled amount and cancelled, aka fill/cancellation-records. The protocol also emit \nOrderFilled\n, \nOrderCancelled\n, and \nRingMined\n events. These events can be used by relayers to provide consolidated trading data to wallet users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoopring protocol is open-source at github: \nhttps://github.com/Loopring/protocol\n. We are still working on its very first release.\n\n\nOrder Rings\n\n\nsupersimmetry {\nda447m@yahoo.com\n} came up with this \u300a\nRemarks on Loopring\n\u300b document to explain what order-rings (match-ring) are, when orders can form a valid ring to be filled, and how fill rates are calculated. We really appreciate such an effort and it is worth of a reading. Please be noted in current protocol implementation, the pricing model is the same as in our whitepaper and the above document, but the fee model is different.\n\n\nWhen impelmented in solidity, Loopring protocol doesn't perform calculating exchange rate or amount, but perform verification of miner-supplied exchange amount for each order (specificily, how much each order should pay to the previous order in the ring). This is beause 1) solidity doens't have support for float number computation, especially \npow(x, 1/n)\n, and 2) we prefer math computation to be done by miners to save gas.\n\n\nExchange Rate Verification\n\n\nBelow we are going to describe how rate related verification is done.\n\n\n(TODO)\n\n\nFee Model\n\n\nOur \nwhitepaper\n elaberated a possible income source for ring-miners called \"cost saving share\" or CSS. The nice thing about CSS is that ring-miners' interests and order submitters' interests are aligned - the more ring-miners help save order submitter's cost, the more the ring-miners will gain as income.\n\n\nBut in situations where the actually exchange rates in a ring are exactly the same as each order's original rates, the \"cost saving\" is zero thus the CSS is also zero, therefore ring-miners are not incentivized to submit such a ring as they have no income at all. With the introduction of LRC token, we allow order submitter to specify the amount of LRC to be paid to miners as mining fee. This mining fee is paid proportionally if an order is partially filled.\n\n\nThe innovative part of our fee model is as follows: we only allow ring-miners to choose either LRC fee or CSS, additionally, if ring-miners choose CSS, they must pay back the same amount of LRC back to order submitter as specifed.\n\n\nLets say a order specified 10LRC as fee, assume this order is fully filled and CSS is 10S (S is the selling token), the miner either collect 10LRC as fee, or collect 10S and pays 10LRC to order submitter.\n\n\nThe Rationals\n\n\n(TODO)",
