We really appreciate such an effort and it is worth of a reading. Please be noted in current protocol implementation, the pricing model is the same as in our whitepaper and the above document, but the fee model is different.\n\n\nWhen impelmented in solidity, Loopring protocol doesn't perform calculating exchange rate or amount, but perform verification of miner-supplied exchange amount for each order (specificily, how much each order should pay to the previous order in the ring). This is beause 1) solidity doens't have support for float number computation, especially \npow(x, 1/n)\n, and 2) we prefer math computation to be done by miners to save gas.\n\n\nExchange Rate Verification\n\n\nBelow we are going to describe how rate related verification is done.\n\n\n(TODO)\n\n\nFee Model\n\n\nOur \nwhitepaper\n elaberated a possible income source for ring-miners called \"margin split\" or 'split'. The nice thing about split is that ring-miners' interests and order submitters' interests are aligned - the more ring-miners help save order submitter's cost, the more the ring-miners will gain as income.\n\n\nBut in situations where the actually exchange rates in a ring are exactly the same as each order's original rates, the margin is zero thus the split is also zero, therefore ring-miners are not incentivized to submit such a ring as they have no income at all. With the introduction of LRC token, we allow order submitter to specify the amount of LRC to be paid to miners as mining fee. This mining fee is paid proportionally if an order is partially filled.\n\n\nThe innovative part of our fee model is as follows: we only allow ring-miners to choose either LRC fee or split, additionally, if ring-miners choose split, they must pay back the same amount of LRC back to order submitter as specifed.\n\n\nLets say a order specified 10LRC as fee, assume this order is fully filled and split is 10S (S is the selling token), the miner either collect 10LRC as fee, or collect 10S and pays 10LRC to order submitter.\n\n\nIf \nf\n is LRC fee, \nx\n is the split, then miner's income is \ny = max(f, x-f)\n. If we plot this function, we have:\n\n\n\n\nThe Rationals\n\n\nThe orange line represents the split fee model, and the blue line represents our current fee model. As you can see:\n\n\n\n\nif split is 0, miners will choose \nf\n so they still get a constant income, therefore they are certainly incentivized.\n\n\nif \nf\n, the LRC fee is zero, \ny = max(f, x-f)\n becomes \ny = x\n, this is exactly the fee model without LRC involved. So our fee model is just a genelized model.\n\n\nif split's value is equal to or greater than twice the value of LRC fee, miner will choose \nx-f\n.\n\n\n\n\n(TODO)",

            "text": "Our  whitepaper  elaberated a possible income source for ring-miners called \"margin split\" or 'split'. The nice thing about split is that ring-miners' interests and order submitters' interests are aligned - the more ring-miners help save order submitter's cost, the more the ring-miners will gain as income.  But in situations where the actually exchange rates in a ring are exactly the same as each order's original rates, the margin is zero thus the split is also zero, therefore ring-miners are not incentivized to submit such a ring as they have no income at all. With the introduction of LRC token, we allow order submitter to specify the amount of LRC to be paid to miners as mining fee. This mining fee is paid proportionally if an order is partially filled.  The innovative part of our fee model is as follows: we only allow ring-miners to choose either LRC fee or split, additionally, if ring-miners choose split, they must pay back the same amount of LRC back to order submitter as specifed.  Lets say a order specified 10LRC as fee, assume this order is fully filled and split is 10S (S is the selling token), the miner either collect 10LRC as fee, or collect 10S and pays 10LRC to order submitter.  If  f  is LRC fee,  x  is the split, then miner's income is  y = max(f, x-f) . If we plot this function, we have:",

As you can see:   if split is 0, miners will choose  f  so they still get a constant income, therefore they are certainly incentivized.  if  f , the LRC fee is zero,  y = max(f, x-f)  becomes  y = x , this is exactly the fee model without LRC involved. So our fee model is just a genelized model.  if split's value is equal to or greater than twice the value of LRC fee, miner will choose  x-f .   (TODO)",
